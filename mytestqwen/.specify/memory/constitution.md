# Spec-Kit Task-Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must meet predefined quality standards. This includes consistent formatting using established style guides, comprehensive documentation for public interfaces, proper error handling, and adherence to security best practices. Code that does not meet these standards will not be merged into the codebase. Code reviews must validate these quality standards before approval. Linting and static analysis tools must be integrated into the development process to ensure consistent enforcement of quality standards across all contributions. This principle ensures maintainable and reliable code for long-term project success. The rationale is that consistent quality standards reduce technical debt, improve maintainability, and enable efficient onboarding of new team members. Any code that fails to meet these quality standards will be rejected during the review process until corrections are made. Regular quality audits must be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with these standards, and teams must provide justification for any deviations from these requirements with appropriate risk assessment and mitigation strategies in place.


### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Testing must be implemented before or alongside feature development, following TDD practices. Unit tests must achieve at least 80% code coverage for new features. Integration and end-to-end tests must validate feature functionality across the system. All bug fixes must include corresponding regression tests to prevent future regressions. Test-driven development ensures robustness and maintainability of the system. This approach catches defects early in the development cycle, reducing time and cost of fixing issues later in the development process. Test suites must be run successfully before any code can be merged to the main branch. Performance and load testing must also be included for features that impact system performance or scalability. The test-first approach ensures that features are designed with testability in mind, leading to better architectural decisions and more maintainable code. All code contributions must include adequate test coverage to validate functionality and prevent regressions, ensuring system stability and reliability.


### III. User Experience Consistency
The user experience must be consistent across all features and interfaces. This includes UI/UX design patterns, interaction models, and accessibility standards. Consistent terminology, visual design elements, and user flows must be maintained throughout the application. Any new feature must follow the established design system and user interaction patterns. User experience consistency is critical for creating an intuitive and predictable product that reduces cognitive load on users. This principle ensures that users can efficiently navigate and use the application without confusion, regardless of which features they interact with. The design system must be documented and maintained to provide clear guidance for implementing consistent user experiences. Regular UX audits must be conducted to ensure ongoing consistency across all features. Accessibility standards must be met to ensure equal access for all users, regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies they may use. New features must undergo UX validation to ensure they integrate seamlessly with existing user flows and maintain the overall consistent experience.


### IV. Front-End and Back-End Functional Alignment
Front-end and back-end development must be aligned functionally to ensure seamless integration and consistent behavior. APIs must be designed with clear contracts that both front-end and back-end teams agree upon. Both teams must collaborate to ensure that functionality implemented on each side works together as intended. API contracts must be versioned appropriately to maintain backward compatibility where needed. Cross-team communication is essential to identify and resolve potential integration issues early. Both front-end and back-end components must maintain consistent data models and business logic where appropriate. Regular sync meetings must be held to align on feature implementation and identify potential integration challenges. This principle ensures that the user-facing functionality works as expected with the underlying data processing and business logic. Proper communication and collaboration between teams prevents discrepancies in functionality that could confuse users or cause system failures. Documentation of API contracts and data flows must be maintained to ensure all team members understand how different system components interact with each other. Both front-end and back-end implementations must follow consistent error handling and data validation patterns to ensure a unified system behavior. 


### V. Observable System Behavior
All system components must provide adequate observability through logging, monitoring, and tracing. Logs must follow structured formats and include sufficient context for debugging. Critical system metrics must be monitored with appropriate alerting. Performance and error metrics must be tracked to proactively identify issues. Proper observability ensures maintainability and reliability of the system in production. System behavior must be transparent to both developers and operators, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues. Standardized logging formats must be implemented across all components to enable centralized log analysis and correlation. Performance metrics must be collected and visualized to identify bottlenecks and performance degradation before they impact users. Error rates, response times, and throughput metrics must be tracked to maintain system health. Distributed tracing must be implemented for complex operations that span multiple system components to enable comprehensive debugging and performance analysis. The observability infrastructure must be scalable and maintainable to support growing system complexity over time. Security events must be logged and monitored to detect and respond to potential security incidents. 


## Additional Constraints

### Security Requirements
All features must implement appropriate security measures including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure communication protocols. Security best practices must be followed in all code implementations. Regular security audits must be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Input validation must be implemented to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. All security-related issues must be addressed with high priority to maintain system integrity and user trust. Access controls must be properly implemented to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to access. Security considerations must be included in all design decisions and code reviews.


### Performance Standards
The system must maintain responsive user interfaces with page load times under 3 seconds. API response times must be under 500ms for 95% of requests. The system must support the expected user load with graceful degradation under high demand. Performance benchmarks must be established for each feature and maintained during development. Performance regression testing must be included in the test suite to prevent performance degradation over time. Resource utilization must be optimized to maintain cost efficiency while meeting performance requirements. Monitoring must be implemented to detect performance issues before they impact users. The system must be designed to scale appropriately to meet growing demand over time. 


## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
All code changes must undergo peer review before merging. Reviewers must validate code quality, test coverage, functionality, and adherence to this constitution. Automated checks must pass before human review is initiated. Reviewers must focus on both correctness and adherence to established standards. Critical bugs and security issues must be identified and addressed during code review. The review process must be efficient but thorough to maintain quality standards. Reviewers must provide constructive feedback to help improve code quality and knowledge sharing. Merge requests must not be approved until all review comments are addressed or acknowledged as non-blocking. The review process must ensure that code meets all quality standards before becoming part of the main codebase. 


### Quality Gates
Before any feature can be released, it must pass all automated tests, security scans, performance benchmarks, and design validations. Code quality metrics must meet predefined thresholds. Both front-end and back-end components must be validated for functional alignment. UX validation must be completed for all user-facing features. Quality gates ensure that only properly validated features reach users. Each quality gate must have clear pass/fail criteria and automated tools where possible to enforce these gates. Features must not bypass quality gates under any circumstances without explicit approval from the technical leadership team. The quality gate process must be transparent and consistently applied across all features. Regular assessment of the quality gate process must be conducted to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. 


## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards within the project. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation from the constitution must be justified with appropriate risk assessment and approved by the technical leadership team. Amendments to this constitution require documentation of rationale, approval from technical leadership, and communication to all team members. The constitution must be referenced during planning sessions and technical decision-making processes. All team members are responsible for upholding these principles and calling out potential violations. The constitution will be reviewed quarterly to ensure it continues to meet the project's evolving needs. New team members must be familiarized with this constitution during onboarding. Regular education and training sessions must be provided to ensure all team members understand and can implement these principles effectively. The constitution should be used as a reference point for resolving technical disputes and making architectural decisions. Use README.md and other project documentation for runtime development guidance and practical implementation details.
